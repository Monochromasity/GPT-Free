    <h1>GPT-Free</h1>
    <h2>GPT-Free is a free and unblocked version of ChatGPT to use if you either do not have an OpenAI account or if you are using a school device. You can use this whenever you like and for no price. You do not need to set up an account to use this tool.</h2>
    <h3>How to Use</h3>
    <p>When you first load up GPT-Free, it will ask you if you would like to start a new chat or import a previous chat. If you have not exported any chats or recieved any chats, type "new chat". The section at the top is the AI's response, and the input at the bottom is your text input. Type anything in the input and it will be sent to the AI which will process your response and give an output. It uses ChatGPT Model "GPT-4". If you need to export your chat, type "export my chat" into the input. This will download a ".gptfree" file. You can import this again when you reload or exit the page. If a response exceeds the character limit and displays "..." at the end of the display, triple-click the text and copy it, and paste it into any notepad software (online or offline) to see the full message. If the response has more than one line, it will ask you if you would like to copy the response. If you type "Y" it will copy it to your clipboard ready to paste anywhere. If you type "N" it will dismiss this message.</p>
